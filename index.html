        <p>I'm not the greatest at  talking about myself is the first thing you should know about me. Beyond that, I really enjoy playing video games and think it would be cool to make some. That's a part of why I'm starting to learn to program. Fun fact, I was in the top 200 players in North America's ranked ladder for a game called League of Legends.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I also really enjoy biking. It's something my significant other has gotten me into recently. We pack the bikes up in her little car and go places to ride! I've found that balancing my indoor time and outdoor time is important. Even if that ratio is something like 80% indoors, the outdoors are important!</p>
        <br>
        <p>Lastly, my nerd doesn't stop just with video games. I love consuming different kinds of media. Mainly watching tv, or anime. But, recently I've been getting sucked in by short stories.  </p>
